			<div style="padding: 0 25%; text-align: left;">Saudade (English: /ˌsaʊˈdɑːdə/) is a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never return. Stronger forms of saudade might be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as a lost lover, or a family member who has gone missing, moved away, separated, or died.<br><br>We have saudade of Inércia Demoparty 2005.<br>Which is why we are organizing it again, 1-3 November 2019, Almada, Portugal.<br>You should come and participate! <a href="https://psenough.github.io/id05_2019/">🔗</a></div>
